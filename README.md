Welcome to the Brain Games!

You are invited to test your mathematical knowledge in five short entertaining games, each of which will make your brain strain a little! <br>
Only three rounds in each of the games separate you from the honorary title of the Winner of the Brain Games!

<h4>Demonstration of the gameplay of each of the games:</h4>

## Installation

### 1. Cloning repository into your system
```console
git clone https://github.com/RomanKorsunov/fullstack-javascript-project-44.git
```

### 2. Install all the necessary dependencies
```console
npm ci
```

### 3. Run each game using the commands listed below in the instructions


## Launch
Each of the game is run by a command with the appropriate name:
<br>

<dl>
            <a href="#brain-even"><dt>brain-even</dt></a>
            <dd>In this game, you will be required to correctly determine whether the represented number is even or not. 
            Please note that the correct answer is only "yes" or "no" - any other set of characters will be interpreted as an incorrect answer.</dd>
            <a href="#brain-calc"><dt>brain-calc</dt></a>
            <dd>In this game you will be asked to calculate the presented expression correctly. As a gesture of goodwill, we have limited the set of operations to these three: addition, subtraction and multiplication. 
            Wait for an expression with finding the square root of a number and exponentiation in version 2.0!</dd>
            <a href="#brain-gcd"><dt>brain-gcd</dt></a>
            <dd>This game will force you to determine the greatest common divisor of two specified numbers. 
            Don't worry, the link to the article "what is the greatest common divisor?" and the GCD calculator will be below.</dd>
            <a href="#brain-progresiion"><dt>brain-progression</dt></a>
            <dd>In this game, you will need to determine which number was hidden in the presented arithmetic progression. 
            It took us the most time to create this game, so please go through it several times.</dd>
            <a href="#brain-prime"><dt>brain-prime</dt></a>
            <dd>In this game, it is necessary to determine exactly whether the represented number is prime or not. 
            Remember that only "yes" or "no" answers are accepted - it is better to send your outraged messages to the author in direct.</dd>
</dl>

## Example:
            
```console
brain-even
